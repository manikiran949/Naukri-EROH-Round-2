# E-Commerce Last-Mile Delivery Optimization

A solution for a multi-billion dollar e-commerce company facing heavy traffic congestion. This system uses both third-party and in-house delivery agents, addressing slow deliveries, high logistics costs, and customer satisfaction challenges.

## Core Strategy

Our solution integrates **three key components** implemented in C++ (core pseudo code provided) that work together to improve delivery speed, lower costs, and ensure reliability.

### 1. AI-Driven Route Optimization

- **What It Does:**  
  Finds the fastest routes for delivery agents despite traffic.

- **How It Works:**  
  - **City as a Graph:**  
    Roads are edges (with travel time weights) and intersections/delivery points are nodes.
  - **Routing Algorithms:**  
    - **A\*** for single deliveries to quickly compute the shortest path.
    - **Simplified VRP Solver (Nearest-Neighbor):**  
      For multiple deliveries per agent, choose the closest delivery next.
  - **Real-Time Traffic Updates:**  
    Hourly updates (via Google Maps API or similar) adjust edge weights; instant rerouting occurs if a road is blocked.
  - **Advanced Traffic Prediction Using ML:**  
    Machine learning models (e.g., LSTM or Random Forests) forecast traffic using historical data, weather, and real-time inputs. Predictions are integrated into the A\* algorithm to proactively avoid congested areas.

- **Outcome:**  
  Reduces travel time by preempting traffic jams, contributing to the overall 30% delivery time reduction.

### 2. Real-Time Demand Forecasting

- **What It Does:**  
  Predicts order volumes to efficiently plan agent staffing.

- **How It Works:**  
  Utilizes exponential smoothing with the formula:

Updates continuously as orders come in, adapting to changes (e.g., sales spikes or inclement weather).

- **Outcome:**  
Prevents overstaffing (reducing costs) and understaffing (preventing delays).

### 3. Dynamic Pricing for Delivery Slots

- **What It Does:**  
Balances demand by adjusting delivery slot prices.

- **How It Works:**  
Uses a pricing formula:

- **Example:**  
  If demand is 100 orders and only 50 agents are free, the price may rise to ₹200.

- **Outcome:**  
Shifts deliveries to less busy periods, reducing peak-hour strain and associated costs.

## Quantitative Model

### Baseline Metrics
- **Delivery Time:**  
Current: 1 hour → Target: 42 minutes (30% reduction)
- **Cost:**  
Current: ₹100 per delivery → Target: ₹80 per delivery (20% reduction)

### Delivery Time Reduction
- **Breakdown:**  
- Travel time: 48 minutes (80%)  
- Loading/unloading: 12 minutes (20%)
- **Target:**  
Reduce travel time to 30 minutes (total 42 minutes)
- **Result:**  
AI routing cuts travel time from 48 to 28.8 minutes (40% reduction), exceeding the target.

### Cost Reduction
- **Breakdown:**  
- Fuel/Maintenance: ₹50 (50%)  
- Wages: ₹40 (40%)  
- Fixed Costs: ₹10 (10%)
- **Savings:**  
- Fuel: 40% reduction → ₹50 × 0.6 = ₹30  
- Wages: 10% reduction → ₹40 × 0.9 = ₹36  
- Fixed: Remains at ₹10  
- **New Cost:**  
₹30 + ₹36 + ₹10 = ₹76 (24% reduction)

### Customer Satisfaction
- **Goal:** 95% on-time deliveries  
- **Result:**  
Achieved via optimized routing and balanced staffing.
